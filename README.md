# Module 15: Leaflet Challenge üó∫Ô∏è

## Background

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is committed to providing scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystem health, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. To enhance their capabilities in visualizing earthquake data, a project was initiated to develop tools for a more meaningful representation of the vast amount of data collected worldwide.

## Project Overview

This project, named "leaflet-challenge," aimed to create tools for visualizing earthquake data using Leaflet, allowing the USGS to better educate the public and government organizations about global seismic activity and related issues.

## Project Setup

1. **Repository Creation:**
   - A new repository was created for this project named "leaflet-challenge."
   - The project was not added to an existing repository to maintain organization and clarity.

2. **Local Setup:**
   - The repository was cloned to the local machine to facilitate development and testing.

3. **Folder Structure:**
   - Inside the local git repository, two directories were created: `Leaflet-Part-1` and `Leaflet-Part-2`, corresponding to the challenges outlined in the project.

4. **File Structure:**
   - Necessary files, including HTML and JavaScript, were added to the repository. These files are essential for running the analysis.

5. **GitHub Push:**
   - Changes, including the new repository creation and folder setup, were pushed to GitHub for collaboration and version control.

## Earthquake Visualization

### Task Summary

1. **Dataset Retrieval:**
   - Earthquake data was obtained from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page, selecting a dataset such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."

2. **Data Import and Visualization:**
   - Utilizing Leaflet, a map was created to plot earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
   - Data markers were customized to reflect earthquake magnitude through size and earthquake depth through color.

3. **Additional Features:**
   - Popups were added to provide extra information about each earthquake when the associated marker was clicked.
   - A legend was implemented to provide context for the map data.

## Conclusion

This project successfully addressed the USGS's need for enhanced earthquake data visualization tools. The implemented solution provides an informative and interactive map that aids in educating the public and government organizations about global seismic activities.
